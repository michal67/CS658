  <p>This is our breadcrumbs application for CS658. We are currently working on development and attempting to improve functionality whenever we can. In this area, we will explain the use of the app and  our plans moving forward.

  <h6>Application Use</h6>
  <ol>
    <li>
      On applicaton start up, the user will be presented with a start run button. Once this button is clicked, the user will then be taken
      to a page that displays thier run information. Allowing them to see thier time, distance and current location and route on a map.
    </li>
    <li>
      From here the user can choose to end the run. Ending the run will display the final results then allow the user to return to the home page to begin again.
    </li>

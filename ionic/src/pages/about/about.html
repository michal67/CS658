  <p>This is our breadcrumbs application for CS658. We are currently working on development and attempting to improve functionality whenever we can. 
      In this about we will explain the use of the app and  our plans moving forward.  
  </p>
  <h6>Application Use</h6>
  <ol>
    <li>
      On applicaton start up, the user will be presented with a start run button. Once this button is clicked, the user will then be taken
      to a page that displays thier run information. Allowing them to see thier time, distance and current location and route on a map.
    </li>
    <li>
      From here the user can either choose to pause the run, then continue, or can choose to end the run. Ending the run will display the final
      results then allow the user to start another run again.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h6>Planned Development</h6>
  <ol>
    <li>
      We plan to add the functionality to store user data, and have a login screen at application start up
    </li>
    <li>
      We plan to add added functionality to the end of run screen, displaying more accurate and percise data at the user's request.
    </li>
    <li>
      We plan to refactor the look of the app to make it more unique, eye-catching, and easy to use.
    </li>
  </ol>
    <h6>
      Thank you for using our application!
